# In The Loop - v2

![Build Badge](https://github.com/becp12/in-the-loop-v2/actions/workflows/main_in-the-loop-v2.yml/badge.svg)

In The Loop is a web app for people who enjoy crochet, knitting or other yarn crafts and want a way to track various parts of their crafting journey, whether it be tracking their WIPS (Work in Progress), track the yarn they have in their collection, learn new stiches, or keep a digital library of their patterns, this is the app for them.

The first feature to implement was a Project Tracker. This was the most important feature to include in this app as when you have multiple projects on the go, it's hard to remember what pattern, yarn, hook, needle etc that you're using for each project. This feature takes out the guesswork as it records all of these things.

Features to be included in this app:
- Project Tracking [in progress]
- Yarn Stash Tracking [future feature]
- Pattern Library [future feature]
- Stitch Library [future feature]

Something I would like to include (but it isn't urgent, and I will decide to add via user research on if it would be used):
* Social Feed
    * This would allow people to see a "live feed" of other projects other people have added. There would be an option when creating a new project if they want to make their project private or public. If it's public, it will show on the live feed and people can leave comments on any projects that are public. It would share you first name but no other identifying information.

Through user interaction online, there have been a few other features suggested but they are not on the plan to be implemented yet.

Those features are:
- Crochet Chart Designer
- Yarn Barcode Scanner (add to stash easily)
- Yarn Calculator (how much yarn required for a certain project)
- Project timer
- Price calculator
